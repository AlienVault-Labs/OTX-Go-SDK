### API Keys
If you haven't signed up, please visit [https://otx.alienvault.com/](https://otx.alienvault.com/accounts/signup/) and do so!

Then, you can login and find your api key in your [account settings](https://otx.alienvault.com/settings/).

Once you have your API Key, set it as an environment variable:
```export X_OTX_API_KEY=mysecretkey```
```echo $X_OTX_API_KEY```

or in your go code:
```os.Setenv("X_OTX_API_KEY", "ab91e98e6dcac6303bd1522d3542f91fcb4be176ea262ecd892d39e0d82a218b")```

For use with curl, or to write your own client, set the api key as a HTTP Header:
```X-OTX-API-KEY: "ab91e98e6dcac6303bd1522d3542f91fcb4be176ea262ecd892d39e0d82a218b"```
